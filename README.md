About
-----

Creating Modpacks with Voodoo requires minimal effort, just create one `.kt` definition per modpack

You can Test Any pack in MultiMC, creating a instance and launching it is completely automated, no more clicking than necessary

Modern Minecraft versions (1.6.+) and Forge are supported (older versions do not have mods on curseforge)

packages to [SKCraft Launcher](https://github.com/SKCraft/Launcher#skcraft-launcher) Pack Format

**No Rehosting of Mods!** completely automated by preparing `.url.txt` files for SKLauncher

Reproducability: with a modpacks `.lock.hjson` file and `src` folder you can reproduce the modpack on any platform, server install or local testing
(given that the urls do not get taken down or redirect anywhere else)

Minimalistic Packs: on all platforms that support it (SK and the multimc-wrapper) mods will be downloaded by the user from the original location,  


Is Voodoo for you?
-------------------

Want to make a modpack ? quickly test locally and then make it available on multiple platforms for users ?

voodoo is a set of tools to quickly prepare, build, test and deploy modpacks to users and servers

Voodoo might be for you if: 

:heavy_check_mark: You want a fast and mostly automated process  
:heavy_check_mark: You want to be able to update the modpack whenever you want  
:heavy_check_mark: You don't want to depend on anyone else  

or

:heavy_check_mark: You already use SKCraft Launcher  

### Cons
It may not be for you if:

:small_orange_diamond: You do not feel comfortable using a shell  
:small_orange_diamond: You do not feel comfortable using a IDE or text editor with syntax highlighting  
:small_orange_diamond: You don't have a website or place for people to download files from 
and do not want to publish files to curse  
:small_orange_diamond: You don't want anything to do with distributing the launcher or pack  

This applies to different modules of voodoo individually.. without a place to host files you can still export
a pack and upload it to curse, it will just be a much slower process due to approval and waiting time

Docs & Guides

- [Import](docs/import)
- [Testing](docs/testing)
- [Server](docs/server)

Developing
----------

when building locally you can use a development version of voodoo from `mavenLocal`

```kotlin
dependencies {
    mavenLocal()
}
```

unix: `./gradlew publishToMavenLocal`  
windows: `./gradlew.bat publishToMavenLocal`

## using dev plugin

use `-dev` on the plugin version and add `mavenLocal()` to the dependencies of plugins and in the main buildscript

[build.gradle.kts](https://github.com/elytra/Voodoo/blob/master/samples/build.gradle.kts)  
[settings.gradle.kts](https://github.com/elytra/Voodoo/blob/master/samples/settings.gradle.kts)  

Task Shortcuts
--------------

for all tasks shortcuts can be registered in the `build.gradle.kts`
```kotlin
voodoo {
    addTask(name = "rebuildAndTestMMC", parameters = listOf("build", "test mmc"))
    addTask(name = "build", parameters = listOf("build"))
    addTask(name = "sk", parameters = listOf("pack sk"))
    addTask(name = "server", parameters = listOf("pack server"))
    addTask(name = "buildAndPackAll", parameters = listOf("build", "pack sk", "pack server", "pack mmc"))
}
```
these tasks will be registered for each modpack, eg `cotm_rebuildAndTestMMC` would 
execute cotm to build the pack and then open the multimc5 test client

Usage examples
--------------

examples based on [Center of the Multiverse](https://github.com/elytra/Center-of-the-Multiverse)

Learn how to define your `$pack.kt` in [docs/setup](docs/setup)

other samples: [samples](samples) 

[Voodoo Samples](https://github.com/NikkyAI/VoodooSamples)

## Server Deployment

create a server package \
`./gradlew cotm pack server -o ".server"`

that creates a server *package* in `.server/`
 1. upload that package to **different** folder on your minecraft server
 2. stop the minecraft server and
 3. execute the server installer with the actual location of your minecraft server installation \
    eg. `java -jar server-installer ../actualServer`

this will:
 - update configs/files
 - install mods
 - install/update forge
 - create `forge.jar`

## MultiMC Integration / Deployment

To run a test instance use \
`./gradlew cotm test mmc`

to compile a minimalistic MMC pack that selfupdates using the skcraft data \
`./gradlew cotm pack mmc` \
this expects a file `multimc/${packname}.url.txt` that points at the previously uploaded skcraft pack \
more specifically the json file of the pack

Maven
-----

Voodoo is available on the elytradev maven
(recommended usage is via gradle plugin, see [docs/setup](docs/setup) )
gradle:
```kotlin
repositories {
    maven(url = "https://repo.elytradev.com") { name = "elytradev" }   
    maven(url = "https://dl.bintray.com/kotlin/kotlin-eap/") { name = "Kotlin EAP" }
    maven(url = "https://kotlin.bintray.com/kotlinx") { name = "kotlinx" }
    maven(url = "https://jitpack.io") {name = "jitpack" }
}
dependencies {
    implementation(group = "moe.nikky.voodoo", name = "voodoo", version = "0.4+")
}
```


for builds not on master add the branch name to the groupId
eg. `moe.nikky.voodoo-rewrite`
